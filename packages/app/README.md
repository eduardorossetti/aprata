# Getting Started with Project-Aprata

This React project is focused on front-end development using various libraries and tools.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make edits.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes for the best performance.

### `pnpm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.

### `pnpm run predeploy`

Builds the app before deployment.

### `pnpm run deploy`

Deploys the app using `gh-pages` to the configured hosting platform.
